If the party filing the first document in the proceedings is unable, after reasonable enquiry, to discover the identification number of the person, entity or property, he may state immediately below or after the name of the same “(ID No. not known)”.

The number should be preceded by the prefix “FIN No.”

For example: “Japanese Identification Card No.”
