# Part IV – Processes relating to Children

## 8. Child Representative

(1) The Court may on its own motion, or either party may make an application for the court
to appoint a Child Representative pursuant to rule 30 of the Family Justice Rules.

(2) Upon the making of an order for the appointment of a Child Representative, the
Registrar will select a member from the Child Representative panel and send a letter of
request of acceptance of the appointment by email to the selected member. The member
may choose to decline such an appointment. If no response is received within 3 working
days of the email, the member is deemed to have declined the appointment.

(3) All members on the Child Representative panel shall inform the Court of any changes
to their email addresses.

(4) Upon acceptance of the appointment, the Child Representative will receive a letter from
the Registrar confirming the appointment, providing the contact details of the parties
and a date of a case conference. The following documents may be enclosed with the
letter:

: (a) an Information Sheet on Child Representative, which the Child Representative
is to give to the parties at the earliest possible opportunity together with any
further explanation which the Child Representative deems fit, in compliance
with Family Justice Rules and paragraph (7) below;

: (b) a Child Representative Practice Note, which the Child Representative is to read
carefully and adhere to;

: (c) a Child Representative Checklist, which will be used at the case conference; and

: (d) a Questionnaire to the parties, which the Child Representative might use to
obtain information from the parties.

(5) Within 7 days from the receipt of the confirmation of appointment as described in
paragraph (4) above, the Child Representative shall serve file and serve a Notice of
Address for Service on Child Representative (Form 187 of Appendix A to these Practice
Directions) on the parties to the proceedings.

(6) The unique role of the Child Representative is to ascertain the wishes of the child, keep
the child informed and do the necessary to protect the child’s best interest. The Child
Representative is also duty bound to ensure that the Court is apprised of all matters
relevant to the interest of the child.


(7) Upon accepting the appointment referred to in paragraph (4) above, the Child
Representative should act expeditiously in fulfilment of his/her duties as set out in rule
31 of the Family Justice Rules, including the following:

: (a) providing the parties and/or solicitors with information about the role of the
Child Representative and informing them of the requirements in respect of their
communications with the Child Representative and any contributions towards
the costs of the Child Representative which the Court may have ordered; and

: (b) developing and implementing a plan for engaging the child and involving the
child in the decision making process in consultation with any other professional
who may be working with the child.

(8) In the event that the Child Representative wishes the Court to make any orders which
the Child Representative is of the view necessary for the fulfilment of his/her duties, it
shall be done by way of an inter-partes Summons under the proceedings.

(9) In the event that the Child Representative suspects that the child is a victim of abuse,
the Child Representative must immediately inform Child Protection Services of the
Ministry of Social and Family Development. The Child Representative must also
inform the Court by way of letter at the earliest opportunity. The Judge may in his/her
discretion call for a case conference.

(10) Where there are any matters which the Child Representative is of the view should only
be shared in confidence with the Court in the best interest of the child, the Child
Representative should write to court requesting for a case conference with the Judge
presiding over the matter. The Judge may in his/her discretion call for a case conference
only with the Child Representative. If there are any urgent issues relating to the safety
of the child, the Child Representative must write to court immediately requesting for
urgent audience.

(11) The Child Representative shall file in Court and serve on parties a Written Submission
in Form 188 of Appendix A within the time frame directed by the Court.

(12) All correspondence to Court from the Child Representative or the parties shall be copied
to the other party and the Child Representative (unless the Child Representative has
been discharged) including that in paragraph (10) above.


## 9. Examination of children

(1) Applicants for the leave of the Court for a child to be examined or assessed under rule
35 of the Family Justice Rules must draft their applications in the prescribed format in
Form 189 in Appendix A to these Practice Directions, with the appropriate
modifications to suit the individual case.

(2) A draft Letter of Instruction to Expert Witness in the prescribed format in Form 190 in
Appendix A to these Practice Directions, together with the relevant Schedules, must be
annexed to the application.

(3) If parties are unable to agree on the expert to be appointed, the Court may consider
appointing an expert from the panel of doctors in the Institute of Mental Health.


## 10. Arrangements for the welfare of children

(1) Section 123 of the Women’s Charter (Cap. 353) sets out the restrictions on the making
of the interim judgment final for divorce or nullity of marriage or the granting of a
judgment of judicial separation before proper arrangements for the welfare of the
children have been made.

(2) To enable the Court to discharge its duty under section 123, counsel should, at the
hearing of the proceedings, inform the Court —

: (a) whether there are relevant children to whom the section applies;

: (b) whether arrangements have or have not been made for the welfare of the
children and that if arrangements have been made, whether they are satisfactory
or are the best that can be devised in the circumstances;

: (c) whether or not it is impracticable for the party or parties appearing before the
Court to make such agreements; and

: (d) whether or not the circumstances make it desirable that the interim judgment
should be made final or as the case may be, that the judgment of judicial
separation should be granted without delay.
