# Part XII – Probate Proceedings

## 62. Applications for grant of probate or letters of administration

**_Filing of originating summons and supporting documents_**

(1) An application for the grant of probate or letters of administration made under rule 208 of the Family Justice Rules shall be made by originating summons with supporting affidavit. The supporting affidavit shall exhibit a Statement in Form 51 in Appendix A of these Practice Directions, a certified true copy of the will and other supporting papers.

(2) Prior to filing the originating summons, the applicant must conduct a litigation search in the record of caveats and the record of probate applications and endorse a certificate in Form 52 in Appendix A to these Practice Directions on the originating summons. The search reports shall be annexed to the originating summons.

(3) For deaths occurring before 1 January 2015, the applicant is required to annex the search reports from the Supreme Court, Family Justice Courts and State Courts. For deaths occurring on or after 1 January 2015, the applicant is required to annex the search reports from the Family Justice Courts. The applicant is required to annex the search reports for the year in which the application for a grant is filed as well as the search reports for the years that the litigation search indicates there were applications or caveats filed with respect to the estate.

(4) The originating summons and the Statement shall be submitted by entering the relevant information in the appropriate electronic form. The following documents shall be submitted at the same time as the originating summons and Statement –

> (a) a certified true copy of the death certificate of the deceased or a certified true copy of the Order of Court for presumption of death of the deceased;

> (b) where there is a Will, a certified true copy of the Will. (The certified true copy of the Will shall contain the certification “This is a certified true copy of the original Will of [name of deceased] dated [date].” on a covering page that is to be attached to the copy of the Will.); and

> (c) in the case of a resealing of a grant, a sealed certified true copy of the foreign grant.

(5) Once the originating summons, Statement, certified true copy of the death certificate and certified true copy of the Will/foreign grant are filed, an electronic filing checklist will be generated and a provisional reference number will be issued. The following supporting documents (whichever may be relevant) must then be filed using the electronic filing checklist:

> (a) in the case of Muslim estates, a certified true copy of the inheritance certificate;

> (b) in relation to deaths occurring on or after 15 February 2008, a Schedule of Assets listing the property comprising the estate of the deceased in accordance with Paragraph 67 of these Practice Directions (if available); and

> (c) any other documents in support of the originating summons required under the Probate and Administration Act (Cap. 251), the Family Justice Rules or by the Court.

(The administration oath under section 28 of the Probate and Administration Act may, however, be filed at the same time as the supporting affidavit under rule 208 of the Family Justice Rules as required by Paragraph 63.)

(6) The electronic filing checklist will indicate the status of the documents filed. It will be the means by which the Court indicates whether any further or corrective action is required on the part of the applicant. The provisional reference number allows for the easy referencing and monitoring of the electronic filing checklist during the initial phase of filing.

(7) The original Will, original foreign grant or sealed certified true copy of the foreign grant (if any,) must be submitted to the Probate Counter by 4.30 p.m. of the next working day after the filing of the originating summons for verification. Where the original Will has been retained in the custody of a foreign court, a certified true copy of the Will by that foreign court must be filed and submitted for verification in place of the original.

(8) The Probate Counter will return the original Will, original foreign grant or sealed certified true copy of the foreign grant to the applicant after verifying that the certified true copy of the document in the court file is an exact copy of the original document submitted.

(9) When the Court is satisfied that the originating summons, Statement and the supporting documents have been properly filed and verified, a probate number will be issued in place of the provisional reference number. This probate number will be tied to the same electronic filing checklist.

**_Rejection of documents_**

(10) The Court may reject any document through the electronic filing checklist or through any other means if there are errors or if the document does not comply with the Family Justice Rules, the Practice Directions, or any other directions made by the Court.
