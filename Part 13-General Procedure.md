# Part XIII - General Procedure

## 72. Originating Summonses

(1) This paragraph applies to originating summonses filed on or after 1 January 2006.

**_Forms for originating summonses_**

(2) Solicitors’ attention is drawn to rule 327 of the Family Justice Rules which provides that no appearance need be entered to an originating summons.

(3) Where any legislation requires a party to file an originating summons and the form is not provided within the legislation, the originating summons must be filed using either Form 47 (Originating Summons) or Form 48 ( _Ex Parte_ Originating Summons) of Appendix A of these Practice Directions.

(4) The parties in Form 47 of Appendix A of these Practice Directions shall be stated as “plaintiff” and “defendant”, or “appellant” and “respondent” as the case may be.

(5) The party in Form 48 of Appendix A of these Practice Directions shall be stated as “applicant”.

**_Originating summons to be heard in open Court_**

(6) Rule 506 of the Family Justice Rules provides that all originating summonses shall be heard in Chambers, subject to any provisions in the Family Justice Rules, written law, directions by the Court, or practice directions issued by the Registrar. 

(7) In addition to any provisions in the Family Justice Rules or other written law, and subject to any further directions made by the Court, the Registrar hereby directs that the following applications made by originating summonses shall be heard in open Court:

> (a) applications by the Public Trustee or any person interested in a property to appoint a receiver of property pending the grant of probate or letters of administration under section 39 of the Probate and Administration Act (Cap. 251).

## 73. Endorsements on originating processes and other documents

(1) Where it is necessary to include endorsements on any document, the directions in this paragraph shall apply.

(2) Endorsements are normally made on originating processes and other documents to show the renewal of, amendments to, and authorisation for service of, the document in question. Such endorsements on originating processes and other documents do not require the Registrar's signature. This is because such endorsements are pursuant to either an order of Court or the Family Justice Rules. The Registrar should therefore not be asked to sign such endorsements.

(3) For documents that are filed through the Electronic Filing Service as electronic forms composed online, the following requirements apply:

> (a) Solicitors should select the appropriate endorsement and check the accuracy of the electronic form in the preview stage before filing the originating process or other document. The acceptance by the Registry of electronic forms composed online does not affect the regularity of any endorsements on the document.

> (b) Where endorsements can be made prior to the filing or issuance of a document, those endorsements shall be incorporated into the document before the document is filed or issued.

> (c) Where endorsements must be made on a document which has already been filed or issued, a fresh copy of the document containing the relevant endorsements shall be prepared, and the document must be re-filed or re-issued, as the case may be. An example of this would be renewals of writs of summons.

## 74. Forms of documents to be filed for proceedings under Chapter 4A of Part X of the Women’s Charter (Cap. 353)

(1) An originating summons for leave under section 121D of the Women’s Charter and rule 40 of the Family Justice Rules to file an application for financial relief under section 121B of the Women’s Charter shall be in Form 227 in Appendix A to these Practice Directions.

(2) The plaintiff’s affidavit in support of the originating summons for leave under section 121D of the Women’s Charter and rule 40 of the Family Justice Rules to file an application for financial relief under section 121B of the Women’s Charter shall be in Form 228 in Appendix A to these Practice Directions.

(3) The plaintiff’s affidavit in support of the originating summons for financial relief under section 121B of the Women’s Charter shall be in Form 229 in Appendix A to these Practice Directions. 

## 75. Distribution of applications

All applications in chambers (including summonses and originating summonses) shall be filed without specifying whether the application is to be heard before a Judge in person or the Registrar. 

## 76. Summonses

(1) All interlocutory applications must be made by way of summons.

(2) Ordinary summonses shall be endorsed “_ex parte_” or “by consent” where applicable. When the summons is endorsed “ex parte”, it must bear a certificate to that effect signed by the solicitors for the applicant. When the summons is endorsed “by consent” and the respondent to the summons is unrepresented, the signature of that respondent with the following endorsement 
 
 “I acknowledge that I have considered the terms of the agreement and have also been informed of my right to seek independent legal advice.” 
 
must be witnessed by an advocate and solicitor or a commissioner for oaths not acting for any of the parties in the proceedings.  

(3) After the filing of any “ _ex parte_ ” or “by consent” summons, the application will be examined by the Judge or Registrar as the case may be. If he is satisfied that the application is in order and all other requirements have been complied with, he may make the order(s) applied for on the day fixed for the hearing of the application without the attendance of the applicant or his solicitor. 

(4) Summonses that are filed using the Electronic Filing Service will be routed to the inbox of the applicant solicitor’s Electronic Filing Service account. Where the summons is filed through the service bureau, it may be collected at the service bureau.

(5) Enquiries by telephone will not be entertained.

(6) Where a summons is filed in a matter for which a trial date has been fixed, the summons must be filed using the Electronic Filing Service with a special request informing the Registry of Family Justice Courts of the trial date(s). 

## 77. Supporting Affidavits for Specific Applications

**Originating Summons for leave to file Writ under section 94 of the Women’s Charter**

> (b) whether the applicant had an earlier opportunity to address the court on these new matters raised; and

> (c) the reasons why the applicant’s response would be relevant and material for the just disposition of the case.

**Summons to vary child-related orders**

(6) An application to vary child-related orders shall be made by way of summons filed in the suit in which the original order was made.

(7) In an application to vary the existing court order(s) on custody, care and control and/or access, the applicant must demonstrate by way of affidavit why it would be in the best interests and welfare of the child for the orders to be varied.

(8) The affidavit in support of the summons shall include the following (where relevant):

> (a) the names, current ages and dates of birth of each child;

> (b) the existing orders relating to custody, care and control and access;

> (c) a table of past variations of custody, care and control and/or access (if any);

> (d) the applicant’s proposed care plan for the child, including the proposed shelter and education-related arrangements;

> (e) if the applicant intends to move overseas with the child after the order is varied, to state the proposed care plan and the proposed access arrangements for the parent left behind;

> (f) if the applicant is an un-discharged bankrupt, an explanation how that party intends to financially provide for the child; and

> (g) the applicant’s explanation why the proposed variation, instead of the status quo, would be in the best interests and welfare of the child.

(9) The applicant must file an affidavit that includes the matters set out in sub-paragraphs (7) and (8) above, even if the other party consents to the variation.

**Summons to vary maintenance orders made under Part X of Women’s Charter**

> (e) Copies of the applicant’s pay slips for the six months immediately preceding the filing of the application for variation of maintenance; and

> (f) Copies of the applicant’s bank statements for the three months immediately preceding the filing of the application for variation of maintenance.

## 78. Personal service of processes and documents

(1) The attention of solicitors is drawn to rule 898(1) of the Family Justice Rules which provides:

> _“Personal service must be effected by a process server of the Court or by a solicitor or a solicitor's clerk whose name and particulars have been notified in the relevant Form to the Registrar for this purpose .”_ [ emphasis added ]

(2) Solicitors are required to notify the Registry of the particulars, and any change thereof, of such clerks who have been authorised by them to serve processes and documents (“authorised process servers”) by submitting a request to authorise user through the Electronic Filing Service. Where such authorised process servers are no longer so authorised, solicitors are to revoke or delete the authorisation immediately by submitting a request through the Electronic Filing Service. Solicitors’ clerks do not require the authorisation of the Registrar to effect personal service of processes and documents.

(3) In view of the alternative modes providing for personal service to be effected by a solicitor or a solicitor's clerk, Court process servers will not be assigned to effect personal service of processes and documents unless there are special reasons.

(4) If it is felt that there are special reasons requiring personal service by a Court process server, a Request for such service should be filed through the Electronic Filing Service, setting out the special reasons. The approval of the Duty Registrar should then be obtained for such service. Once approval has been obtained, the documents for service should be presented at the counter designated for this purpose. A process server will then be assigned to effect service and an appointment for service convenient to both the litigant and the assigned process server will be given.

(5) On the appointed date, the person accompanying the process server should call at the Registry. The amount required for the transport charges of the process server (a record of which will be kept) should be tendered, or, alternatively, the process server in question should be informed that transport for him will be provided. The Registry will then instruct the process server to effect service.

(6) Under no circumstances should any payment be made directly to the process server.

## 79. Substituted and Dispensation of Service

(1) In any application for substituted service, the applicant should persuade the Court that the proposed mode of substituted service will bring the document in question to the notice of the person to be served.

**Application for substituted service by way of posting on the front door at the defendant’s last known address in Singapore (“the address”)**

(2) The applicant should, where appropriate, consider other modes of substituted service, such as AR registered post or electronic means (including electronic mail or Internet transmission) in addition to or in substitution of substituted service by posting on doors or gates of residential and business premises.

(3) Two reasonable attempts at personal service should be made before an application for an order for substituted service is filed. In an application for substituted service, the applicant shall file a supporting affidavit stating the dates, times and outcomes of the said attempts and why he or she believes that such attempts made were reasonable. 

(4) If there is no response for both attempts at personal service (i.e. the door was locked and no one came to the door during both attempts), the plaintiff needs to state in the affidavit —

> (a) the evidence that the defendant is currently residing at the address (for example, relevant search results from the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore, the Singapore Land Authority, the Housing & Development Board or the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority); and

> (b) the grounds for the plaintiff’s belief that the defendant is currently residing at the address, for example, that the plaintiff is also residing at the same address, and sees the defendant every day.

(5) If the plaintiff is not able to state both of the matters set out in sub-paragraph (4)(a) and (b) above in the affidavit, he or she should make attempts to locate the defendant by contacting the defendant’s relatives, friends, and employer(s) (if any), in order to discover the address at which the defendant is currently residing. The affidavit should then include the following matters:

> (a) details of the plaintiff’s last contact with the defendant, including the date, the mode of contact (i.e. over the telephone, a letter, or a meeting), and the contents of any communications made, whether written or oral;

> (b) details of the plaintiff’s knowledge of the defendant’s relatives and friends, and those person(s)’ knowledge of his / her whereabouts (“the defendant’s  contacts”), including their names, addresses and their relationship to the defendant and whether they live in Singapore or overseas;

> (c) details of the plaintiff’s attempts to contact the defendant’s contacts, including the number of such attempts made, the dates and mode of the said attempts (i.e. whether by telephone, letter, or meeting), and the contents of any communications made, whether written or oral;

> (d) the name and address of the defendant’s last known employer (if any), and the result of enquiries the plaintiff has made of that employer as to the defendant’s whereabouts, including the date of such enquiries, the mode of the said enquiries (i.e. whether by telephone, letter, or meeting), and the contents of any communications made, whether written or oral;

> (e) details of the defendant’s nationality.

(6) If the local address at which the defendant is currently residing (not being the matrimonial home) is discovered by the plaintiff pursuant to paragraph (5) above, personal service on the defendant should be attempted at that address in accordance with paragraph (3). Details of the dates, times and outcomes of the personal service are required in the affidavit.

(7) If the response to the attempt at personal service is that the process server is told that the defendant “is overseas”, evidence is required in the affidavit as to what date the defendant will be back in the country.

(8) If it appears from the response to the attempt at personal service that the defendant is permanently overseas, evidence is required in the affidavit as to how the documents will come to the defendant’s attention by being posted on the front door.

(9) If the response to the attempt at personal service is that the defendant has “moved away”, and the plaintiff is alleging that the defendant is evading service, evidence is required in the affidavit to support the plaintiff’s belief that the defendant is evading service.

**Application for substituted service by way of prepaid AR registered post / ordinary post**

(10) An application for substituted service need not be made where an originating process is sent by prepaid AR registered post to the defendant, and the defendant returns the acknowledgement of service, signed by him, in accordance with rule 48(5) and rule 49(3) of the Family Justice Rules. In such a situation, the originating process would be deemed to be duly served on the defendant by registered post.

(11) On an application for substituted service by way of prepaid AR registered post / ordinary post, the plaintiff must state the following matters in the affidavit—

> (a) the grounds for the plaintiff’s belief that the defendant is currently resident at the particular address in respect of which the plaintiff is applying for substituted service by way of prepaid AR registered post / ordinary post; 

> (b) if the application for substituted service by way of prepaid AR registered post / ordinary post is to an overseas address, that the defendant is not ordinarily resident in Singapore;

(12) For the avoidance of doubt, substituted service by prepaid AR registered post is deemed to be effective when the postal service has delivered the document, or attempted to deliver the document (in cases where no one is present or willing to accept the document).

**Application for substituted service by way of email**

(13) If substituted service is by electronic mail, it has to be shown that the electronic mail account to which the document will be sent belongs to the person to be served and that it is currently active.

**Application for substituted service by way of advertisement**

(14) Before an application for substituted service by way of advertisement can be granted, the plaintiff should make attempts to locate the defendant by contacting the defendant’s relatives, friends, and employer(s) (if any), in order to discover the address at which the defendant is currently residing.

(15) The affidavit must include the following:

> (a) the matters set out in sub-paragraph (5)(a) to (e) above;

> (b) details of the defendant’s literacy, and in what language;

> (c) if the advertisement is to be placed in an overseas newspaper, the grounds for the plaintiff’s belief as to why the defendant is thought to be in that particular country.

(16) An application for substituted service by advertisement (in one issue of the Straits Times if the person to be served is literate in English, or one issue of the Straits Times and one issue of one of the main non-English language newspapers where his language literacy is unknown) should only be considered as a last resort and should contain evidence that the person to be served is literate in the language of the newspaper in which the advertisement will be placed. 

**Application for dispensation of service**

(17) Before an application for dispensation of service can be granted, the plaintiff should make attempts to locate the defendant by contacting the defendant’s relatives, friends, and employer(s) (if any), in order to discover the address at which the defendant is currently residing. 

(18) The affidavit must include the following:

> (a) the matters set out in sub-paragraph (5)(a) to (e) above;

> (b) an explanation as to why advertisement would not be effective in bringing the divorce proceedings to the defendant’s notice (for example, that it is not known which country the defendant is currently residing in).

(19) For the avoidance of doubt, posting on the Notice Board of the Registry of the Family Justice Courts is not available as a proposed mode of substituted service.

> > (i) The various items under the request or application shall be organised by theme or type (for example, all items relating to bank accounts to be grouped together, all requests relating to companies to be grouped together, all items relating to a particular property to be grouped together). Each group of items under a particular theme or type shall be
preceded by a heading.

> > (ii) If there are more than 5 sub-items within each item (for example, if bank statements in relation to more than 5 accounts with the same bank are requested), the sub-items shall be organised in either chronological, numerical, or alphabetical order, or alternatively, by themes (for example, all the sub-items relating to housing loan accounts to be listed together, all the sub-items relating to fixed deposits to be listed together).

## 81. Applications for electronic discovery

(1) This Part provides an opt-in framework for requests and applications for the giving of discovery and inspection of electronically stored documents, and the supply of electronic copies of such documents. A party that seeks to rely on this Part must cite the relevant paragraph(s) in any request or application made hereunder.

**_Location of electronically stored documents_**

(2) Electronically stored documents may reside in storage management systems, folders or directories in storage locations, electronic media or recording devices, including folders or directories where temporarily deleted files are located (for example, the Recycle Bin folder or Trash folder). Electronically stored documents or parts thereof may also reside in the unallocated file space or file slack on an electronic medium or recording device as deleted files or file fragments which may be recovered through the use of computer forensic tools or techniques.

**_Definition of metadata information_**

(3) Metadata information refers to the non-visible and not readily apparent information embedded in or associated with electronically stored documents and may include both application metadata, which is created by the application software used to create the electronic documents, and system metadata, which is created by the operating or storage system. Examples of application metadata include hidden columns or text, formatting and display codes, formulae, prior edits and editorial comments; examples of system metadata include data relating to creation, modification and access of the electronic document, its size, file format and storage location, and other document profile information like title, author, subject and keywords or tags. Metadata information may be stored internally within the electronically stored document or externally in a separate file or database. Externally stored metadata information shall be discoverable as separate documents.

**_Time to consider electronic discovery issues during general discovery_**

(4) Parties are encouraged to collaborate in good faith and agree on issues relating to the discovery and inspection of electronically stored documents within the framework for discovery set forth in Part 18 Division 19 of the Family Justice Rules. Such issues may include the scope and/or any limits on documents to be given in discovery, whether parties are prepared to make voluntary disclosures, and the giving of discovery in stages according to an agreed schedule, as well as the format and manner in which copies of discoverable documents shall be supplied.

(5) Parties may, immediately after the close of pleadings, agree on an electronic discovery protocol which may take the form set forth in Appendix B Part 1. Parties may include the agreed electronic discovery protocol in the summons for directions. The Court shall consider the adequacy of the agreed electronic discovery protocol and may make such order or give such direction as it thinks fit, for the just, expeditious and economical disposal of the cause or matter. The agreed electronic discovery protocol, as amended by such order or direction of the Court as the case may be, shall form part of the order under the summons for directions to be extracted for the action.

(6) If parties are unable to agree on an electronic discovery protocol, the party seeking discovery of electronically stored documents may apply for an order. The application must include a draft electronic discovery protocol and must be supported by affidavit providing an account of the parties’ attempts to collaborate in good faith to reach agreement on an electronic discovery protocol.

**_Requests for discovery_**

(7) A request for discovery of any electronically stored document or class of electronically stored documents may be made before the commencement of proceedings, or at any time to any party to a cause or matter, or any person who is not a party to the proceedings. Unless the request specifies that discovery of externally stored metadata information of the requested electronically stored documents is required, the party providing discovery shall not be required to discover externally stored metadata information.

(8) A class of electronically stored documents may be described by specifying or describing a search term or phrase to be used in a reasonable search for electronically stored documents. A request for the giving of discovery by reasonable search must specify or describe limits on the scope of the search; such limits shall include at least the following:

> (a) specifying or describing physical or logical storage locations, media or devices; and

> (b) specifying the period during which the requested electronically stored documents were created, received or modified.

(9) A request shall not be made for the discovery of deleted files or file fragments containing information which may be recovered through the use of computer forensic tools or techniques unless:

> (a) a request is made for the discovery of the electronic medium or recording device on which a forensic inspection is to be conducted; and

> (b) a request is made for inspection of the said electronic medium or recording device in compliance with sub-paragraph (21) to (27).

**_Applications for discovery_**

(10) An application for discovery of any electronically stored document or class of electronically stored documents which includes externally stored metadata information must be supported by an affidavit showing that a request for externally stored metadata information of the requested electronically stored document or class of electronically stored documents had been made previously.

(11) An application for discovery of any electronically stored document or class of electronically stored documents which specifies or describes a search term or phrase to be used in a reasonable search for electronically stored documents must specify or describe limits on the scope of the search to be conducted.

(12) An application for the discovery of a computer database, electronic medium or recording device may be made together with an application for inspection of the said computer database, electronic medium or recording device in accordance with sub- paragraph (21) to (27).

(13) Upon the hearing of an application for an order for discovery of electronically stored documents, the Court shall have regard to the matters set forth in sub-paragraph (15).

(14) Nothing in this paragraph shall prevent the party giving discovery from reviewing the discoverable electronically stored documents or the results of any reasonable search for the purpose of identifying privileged documents. However, such review for the purpose of identifying privileged documents shall not extend to the deletion, removal or alteration of metadata information.

**_Matters to which regard shall be had in determining whether discovery or inspection is necessary_**

(15) Rules 468 and 474 of the Family Justice Rules states that an order for discovery and production of documents for inspection shall not be made unless such order is necessary either for disposing fairly of the cause or matter or for saving costs. The matters to which regard shall be had, in determining whether an application for discovery or inspection (including the supply of copies) of electronically stored documents is necessary either for disposing fairly of the cause or matter or for saving costs, shall include:

> (a) the number of electronic documents involved;
> (b) the nature of the case and complexity of the issues;
> (c) the value of the claim and the financial position of each party;
> (d) the ease and expense of retrieval of any particular electronically stored document or class of electronically stored documents, including —

> > (i) the accessibility, location and likelihood of locating any relevant documents,

> > (ii) the costs of recovering and giving discovery and inspection of any relevant documents,

> > (iii) the likelihood that any relevant documents will be materially altered in the course of recovery, or the giving of discovery or inspection; and

> (e) the significance of any particular electronically stored document or class of electronically stored documents which are likely to be located to the issues in dispute.

**_Form of list_**

(16) The following matters shall be included in any list of documents made pursuant to the  giving of discovery in accordance with this Part in which electronic documents are enumerated:

> (a) the name of the electronic file constituting or containing the electronic document; and

> (b) the file format (and its version) of the electronic document.

(17) Where the party giving discovery objects to the production of certain discoverable electronically stored documents solely on the ground that the internally stored metadata information is protected by privilege, he must state in the list of documents whether he objects to the production of the electronic documents without the internally stored metadata information. If he does not object to the production of the electronic documents without the internally stored metadata information, he must enumerate the electronic documents in Part 1 of Schedule 1 to the list of documents. In any event, he must enumerate such documents in a separate section in Part 2 of Schedule 1 to the list of documents and shall state that he objects to the production of the whole or part of the internally stored metadata information of these documents.

(18) Reasonable efforts shall be made to remove duplicated documents from the list of documents. A document shall be considered a duplicate of another if the contents of both (including metadata information) are identical. The use of a hashing function to identify duplicates shall be deemed to be reasonable effort.

(19) If copies of electronic documents are supplied in one or more read-only optical disc(s) or other storage medium, the party giving discovery shall provide a further list, at the time when such copies are supplied, stating the following:

> (a) the storage format (and its version) of the optical disc or storage medium; and 

> (b) if there are multiple optical discs or storage media, a list of electronic documents stored on each optical disc or storage medium.

(20) An index of documents enumerated in a list of documents referred to in sub-paragraph (16) or (19) above shall be provided in an electronic, text searchable and structured format. In the absence of parties’ agreement, this index or load file shall be provided in a delimited text file in the Comma Separated Value (or ‘CSV’) file format.

**_Inspection of electronically stored documents_**

(21) A party required to produce electronically stored documents for inspection under Part 18 Division 19 of the Family Justice Rules shall provide reasonable means and assistance for the party entitled to inspection to inspect the electronically stored documents in their native format.

(22) Where an inspection is carried out under rule 470, 471 or 472(1) of the Family Justice Rules and the inspecting party wishes to take copies of electronically stored documents produced for inspection, his request to take copies shall comply with the protocol set forth in sub-paragraphs (28) to (33).

**_Inspection of computer databases and electronic media or recording devices_**

(23) No request or application for the inspection of any computer database, electronic medium or recording device shall be made unless discovery of the computer database, electronic medium or recording device has been given.

(24) A request may be made for the inspection of an electronic medium or recording device (for which discovery has been given) for the purpose of recovering deleted electronic documents through the conduct of a forensic examination of the unallocated file space or file slack of the electronic medium or recording device using computer forensic tools or techniques.

(25) Where an application under rule 472(2) is made for the inspection of computer databases, electronic media or recording devices for which discovery has been given, the party seeking inspection shall include in his application an inspection protocol, which may take the form found in Appendix B Part 2, in order to ensure that the party entitled to inspection has access only to electronic documents that are necessary and is not allowed to trawl through the entire database, electronic media or recording device.

(26) Upon the hearing of an application for an order for the inspection of computer databases, electronic media or recording devices, the Court shall have regard to the matters set forth in sub-paragraph (15). The Court shall have the power to review the adequacy of an inspection protocol and may make such order or give such direction as it thinks fit, for the just, expeditious and economical disposal of the cause or matter.

(27) Nothing in this paragraph shall prevent the party producing computer databases, electronic media or recording devices for inspection from reviewing the discoverable electronically stored documents or the results of any reasonable search for the purpose of identifying privileged documents. However, such review for the purpose of identifying privileged documents shall not extend to the deletion, removal or alteration of metadata information.

**_Supply of copies of electronically stored documents_**

(28) Copies of discoverable electronically stored documents shall generally be supplied in the native format in which the requested electronic documents are ordinarily maintained and in one or more read-only optical disc(s).

(29) Metadata information internally stored in the native format of discoverable electronically stored documents shall not be deleted, removed or altered without the agreement of the parties or an order of Court. Where the party giving discovery objects to the production for inspection of certain discoverable electronically stored documents solely on the ground that the internally stored metadata information is protected by privilege, but does not object to the production of the electronic documents without the internally stored metadata information, copies of such documents may be supplied in a reasonably usable format with all or such of the metadata information over which privilege is claimed removed.

**_Requests for the supply of copies_**

(30) A request for copies of discoverable electronically stored documents may specify the format and manner in which such copies are to be supplied. If the party giving discovery does not agree with the specified format or manner or both, he may either: 

> (a) propose a reasonably usable format and/or storage medium and/or a reasonable manner in which he intends to supply copies of the requested electronic documents; or

> (b) in default of agreement, supply copies of the requested electronic documents in accordance with sub-paragraph (1).

(31) The party giving discovery shall not be required to supply copies of electronically stored documents in more than one format.

(32) The file format versions set forth in Appendix B Part 3 shall be deemed to be reasonably usable formats for the purpose of this paragraph.

**_Applications for the supply of copies_**

(33) Applications for the supply of copies of discoverable electronically stored documents shall specify the format and manner in which copies of such electronic documents are to be supplied.

**_Restriction on use of privileged document, inspection of which has been inadvertently allowed_**

(34) Rule 479 of the Family Justice Rules applies to the giving of discovery or inspection of electronically stored documents, including the supply of copies, as it would to the giving of discovery or inspection of any other document.

**_Costs_**

(35) Except for orders made in respect of third party or pre-action discovery, the costs of complying with an order for the giving of discovery or inspection of electronically stored documents shall generally be borne by the party giving discovery; and disbursements incurred in providing copies shall be reimbursed by the party requesting for copies.

(36) The Court may invoke its inherent powers under rules 958 and 959 of the Family Justice Rules to make or give such further orders or directions incidental or consequential to any order as may be necessary, to order the party entitled to discovery to bear the whole or a portion of the costs of compliance with such order for the giving of discovery or inspection of electronically stored documents, and the supply of copies, if such order is necessary to prevent injustice or to prevent an abuse of the process of the Court.

## 82. Applications for discovery or interrogatories against network service providers

(1) This Paragraph applies to an application made under rule 467(1) or rule 495(1) of the Family Justice Rules —

> (a) by or on behalf of an owner or exclusive licensee of copyright material against a network service provider for information relating to the identity of a user of the network service provider's primary network who is alleged to have infringed the copyright in the material in relation to an electronic copy of the material on, or accessible through, the network service provider's primary network; or

> (b) by or on behalf of the performer of a performance against a network service provider for information relating to the identity of a user of the network service provider's primary network who is alleged to have made an unauthorised use of the performance in relation to an electronic recording of the material on, or accessible through, the network service provider's primary network.

(2) An application referred to in sub-paragraph (1) shall —

> (a) be made in Form 47 of Appendix A to these Practice Directions; and

> (b) when made in accordance with sub-paragraph (2)(a), be fixed for hearing within 5 days from the date of filing of the application.

(3) The onus shall lie on the applicant to highlight the nature of the application to the Registry and to request that the application be fixed for hearing within 5 days.

(4) In sub-paragraph (1)(a), the words "electronic copy", "material", "network service provider" and "primary network" have the same meanings as in section 193A(1) of the Copyright Act (Cap 63).

(5) In sub-paragraph (1)(b), the words "electronic recording", "network service provider", "performance" and "primary network" have the same meanings as in section 246(1) of the Copyright Act (Cap 63). 

## 83. Ex parte applications for injunctions

(1) Rule 516 of the Family Justice Rules provides that an application for the grant of an injunction may be made ex parte in cases of urgency. However, the cases of _Castle Fitness Consultancy Pte Ltd v Manz_ [1989] SLR 896 ‘ _The Nagasaki Spirit_ ’ _(No.1)_ [1994] 1 SLR 434 take the position that an opponent to an _ex parte_ application, especially where the application seeks injunctive relief, should be invited to attend at the hearing of the application.

(2) In view of this, any party applying ex parte for an injunction (including a _Mareva_ injunction) must give notice of the application to the other concerned parties prior to the hearing. The notice may be given by way of facsimile transmission or the use of any other electronic means (including electronic mail or Internet transmission), or, in cases of extreme urgency, orally by telephone. Except in cases of extreme urgency or with the leave of the Court, the party shall give a minimum of two hours’ notice to the other parties before the hearing. The notice should inform the other parties of the date, time and place fixed for the hearing of the application and of the nature of the relief sought. If possible, a copy of the originating process, the _ex parte_ summons and supporting affidavit(s) should be given to each of the other parties in draft form as soon as they are ready to be filed in Court. At the hearing of the _ex parte_ application, in the event that some or all of the other parties are not present or represented, the applicant’s solicitors should inform the Court of:

> (a) the attempts that were made to notify the other parties or their solicitors of the making of the application;

> (b) what documents were given to the other parties or their solicitors and when these documents were given; and

> (c) whether the other parties or their solicitors consent to the application being heard without their presence.

(3) The Directions set out in sub-paragraph (2) need not be followed if the giving of the notice to the other parties, or some of them, would or might defeat the purpose of the _ex parte_ application. However, in such cases, the reasons for not following the Directions should be clearly set out in the affidavit prepared in support of the _ex parte_ application. 

## 84. Mareva injunctions

(1) Applicants for _Mareva_ injunctions are required to prepare their orders in accordance with the following forms in Appendix A:

> (a) Form 239: Worldwide _Mareva_ injunction; and

> (b) Form 240: Mareva injunction limited to assets within the jurisdiction.

When composing the summons electronic form online through the Electronic Filing Service, these Forms shall be prepared in Portable Document Format (PDF) and attached to the summons electronic form for an Order of Court in Form 4 or 118 of Appendix A to these Practice Directions.

(2) These forms, inevitably, are complicated, but their language and layout are intended to make it easier for persons served with these orders to understand what they mean. These standard form orders should be used save to the extent that the Judge hearing a particular application considers there is a good reason for adopting a different form. Any departure from the terms of the prescribed forms should be justified by the applicant in his supporting affidavit(s).

(3) The applicant should undertake not to inform any third party of the proceedings until after the return date.

(4) Wherever practicable, applications should be made sufficiently early so as to ensure that the Judge has sufficient time to read and consider the application in advance.

(5) On an _ex parte_ application for a _Mareva_ injunction, an applicant may be required, in an appropriate case, to support his cross-undertaking in damages by a payment to be made into Court, a bond to be issued by an insurance company with a place of business within Singapore, a written guarantee to be issued from a bank with a place of business within Singapore or a payment to the applicant’s solicitor to be held by the solicitor as an officer of the Court pending further order. 

## 85. Documents in support of ex parte applications for injunctions (including Mareva injunctions)

(1) Without prejudice to the requirements stated in Paragraphs 83 and 84 of these Practice Directions, in order to assist the Court hearing _ex parte_ applications for injunctions (including _Mareva_ injunctions), an applicant must include in the affidavit prepared in support of the application the following information under clearly defined headings: 

> (a) reason(s) the application is taken out on an ex parte basis, including whether the applicant believes that there is a risk of dissipation of assets, destruction of evidence or any other prejudicial conduct;

> (b) urgency of the application (if applicable), including whether there is any particular event that may trigger the dissipation of assets, destruction of evidence or any other prejudicial conduct;

> (c) factual basis for the application, including the basis of any belief that there will be dissipation of assets, destruction of evidence or any other prejudicial conduct,

> (d) factual basis for any reasonable defences that may be relied on by the opponent;

> (f) an undertaking to pay for losses that may be caused to the opponent or other persons by the granting of the orders sought, stating what assets are available to meet that undertaking and to whom the assets belong; and : (g) any other material facts which the Court should be aware of.

(2) An applicant must prepare skeletal submissions on the points to be raised at the hearing of the _ex parte_ application. At the hearing, the applicant shall give a copy of the skeletal submissions to the Court and to any opponent present. The applicant shall file the skeletal submissions by the next working day.

(3) The Court may also require the applicant to prepare a note of the hearing setting out the salient points and arguments canvassed before the Court and may order such a note to be served together with the court documents on any opponent who is not present at the hearing or within a reasonable time after the service of the court documents.

> (a) the interest that the person seeking permission has in the matter before the Court;

> (b) the interests of the litigants;

> (c) the reasons for which such permission is sought; and

> (d) the Court’s interest in preserving and upholding its authority and dignity.

(4) In granting interested persons the permission to attend hearings in a Family Justice Court, the Court may, in its discretion, impose the necessary conditions to be complied with.
 
## 88. Electronic filing of documents and authorities for use in Court

(1) Subject to any Directions in this Part to the contrary, in particular Paragraph 90(3), all bundles of documents, bundles of authorities, bundles of pleadings, bundles of affidavits, all other bundles, and all opening statements for proceedings which have been commenced using the Electronic Filing Service must be filed in Court using the Electronic Filing Service.

(2) In the event that it is not possible to file the documents in advance of the hearing, counsel may apply to the Judge or Registrar conducting the hearing for leave to use paper documents during the hearing. The paper documents may be printed on one side or both sides of each paper. The solicitor must explain why it was not possible to file the documents in advance of the hearing, and must give an undertaking to file using the Electronic Filing Service all the documents used at the hearing by the next working day after the hearing. Any document not filed using the Electronic Filing Service will not be included in the Court's case file.

> (d) The table of contents shall contain a concise statement of the relevance of each authority to the specific issues before the Court. The relevance of each authority shall be succinctly expressed and comprise no more than 3 sentences. The statement shall be set out immediately after the name of the case. For example:

> _Rickshaw Investments Ltd and another v Nicolai Baron von Uexkull [2007] 1 SLR(R) 377_

> (c) The page number of each printed bundle must correspond to the page number in the Portable Document Format (PDF) version of that bundle. Each separate bundle of documents shall start at page 1 and every page shall be numbered consecutively.

## 89. Bundle of Documents filed on setting down

(1) Rule 566 of the Family Justice Rules requires a bundle containing certain documents to be filed together with the notice for setting down. The documents in the bundle should be included in the order in which these appear in rule 566(1):

**Filing documents when setting down**

>(1) The party setting down an action for trial must file with the Registrar a notice for setting down an action for trial in Form 119 together with a bundle for the use of the Judge consisting of one copy of each of the following documents:

>> (a) the writ;

>> (b) the pleadings (including any affidavits ordered to stand as pleadings), any notice or order for particulars and the particulars given; and 

>> (c) all orders made on the summons for directions.

(2) In addition, parties should endeavour to file a core bundle of documents. This core bundle should comprise only documents that are relevant to the hearing in question, or which will be referred to in the course of the hearing.

(3) These documents must be prepared in an electronic format. If there are other documents, the relevance of which is uncertain, these documents should be included and any objections taken before the trial Judge.

**_Directions for electronic creation and filing of bundles of documents_**

(4) The following directions shall apply to the filing of bundles:

> (a) Index pages shall be prepared. Bookmarks should be created in the Portable Document Format (PDF) file for each such reference in the index. There should be as many book-marks in that PDF file as there are references in the index to documents in that PDF file.

> (b) The name given to each bookmark should be the same as the corresponding reference in the index.

> (c) The various PDF documents should be arranged chronologically or in some logical order.

> (d) The page number of each bundle of documents must correspond to the page number in the Portable Document Format (PDF) version of that bundle. Each separate bundle of documents shall start at page 1 and every page shall be numbered consecutively.

(5) For proceedings using the Electronic Filing Service, a bundle of documents may be created online and filed through the Electronic Filing Service. The electronic bundle shall be created in Portable Document Format (PDF). The electronic bundle may contain:

> (b) documents that have been uploaded into the electronic case file by solicitors or other persons given access to the shared folder in the electronic case file.
 
## 90. Documents for use in trials

(1) This Paragraph shall apply to trials of —

> (a) writ actions; and

> (b) originating summonses ordered to be continued as if the cause of action had been begun by writ.

(2) Rule 567 of the Family Justice Rules requires the originals of the affidavits of the evidence-in-chief of all witnesses and a bundle of documents to be filed not less than 5 working days before the trial of an action. This Paragraph prescribes the contents and the format of the bundle of documents. In addition, to improve the conduct of family proceedings and to reduce the time taken in the presentation of cases in Court, the following documents shall also be prepared by the respective solicitors of the parties:

> (a) a bundle of authorities; and

> (b) an opening statement.

**_Documents which need not be filed electronically_**

(3) Paragraphs 88, 89(2) to (6) of these Practice Directions do not apply to the documents that are filed in Court pursuant to the provisions of rule 567(1) of the Family Justice Rules. Such documents may be tendered to the Registry in hardcopy together with an electronic copy stored on a CD-ROM in PDF format and complying with the provisions of this Paragraph.

(4) Any court fees payable, pursuant to Part 19 of the Family Justice Rules, on filing the documents in this Paragraph, shall be payable at the stamp office. Parties should, when making payment at the stamp office, indicate to the cashier the precise number of pages which comprise the documents and comply with the provisions of Paragraph 157 of these Practice Directions.

(5) It is emphasised that payment of the court fees on such documents should be made before the documents are tendered to Court in compliance with rule 567 of the Family Justice Rules. The hardcopy of documents tendered to Court should show, on the front page, the amount of court fees paid on the document.

(6) The electronic copy must tally in all respects with the hardcopy, as it will be uploaded into the case file by the Registry staff and will form part of the electronic case file. The importance of not submitting unnecessarily large electronic files is emphasised. To this end, parties are to adhere as far as possible to the guidelines set out on the Electronic Filing Service website (currently at [http://www.elitigation.sg](http://www.elitigation.sg)), or its equivalent as may be set up from time to time, on the resolution to be used when scanning documents into PDF format.

(7) In the event that parties elect to electronically file such documents, they must nevertheless tender a bundle of these documents to the Family Registry in hard copy. It shall not be necessary to pay any additional court fees in respect of the hard copy in such circumstances.

**_Bundle of documents_**

(8) The bundle of documents required to be filed by rule 567 of the Family Justice Rules should be paginated consecutively throughout at the top right hand corner and may be printed on one side or both sides of each page.

> (a) An index of contents of each bundle in the manner and form set out in Form 205 in Appendix A to these Practice Directions must also be furnished. No bundle of documents is necessary in cases where parties are not relying on any document at the trial.

> (b) Under rule 567(3) of the Family Justice Rules it is the responsibility of solicitors for all parties to agree and prepare an agreed bundle as soon as possible. The scope to which the agreement extends must be stated in the index sheet of the agreed bundle.

> (c) The documents in the bundles should —

> >  (i) be firmly secured together with plastic ring binding or plastic spine thermal binding, and such rings or spines should be red for plaintiffs and blue for defendants with a transparent plastic cover in front and at the back;

> >  (ii) have flags to mark out documents to which repeated references will be made in the course of hearing, and such flags shall —

> > > (A) bear the appropriate indicium by which the document is indicated in the index of contents; and

> > > (B) be spaced out evenly along the right side of the bundle so that as far as possible they do not overlap one another; and

> >  (iii) be legible (for which purpose clear legible photo-copies of original documents may be exhibited instead of the originals provided the originals are made available for inspection by the other parties before the hearing and by the Judge at the hearing).

> (d) Where originals and copies of documents are included in one bundle, it should be stated in the index which documents are originals and which are copies.

> (e) Only documents which are relevant or necessary for the trial shall be included in the bundles. In cases where the Court is of the opinion that costs have been wasted by the inclusion of unnecessary documents, the Court will have no hesitation in making a special order for costs against the relevant person.

> (f) A core bundle should (unless clearly unnecessary) also be provided containing the most important documents upon which the case will turn or to which repeated reference will have to be made. The documents in this bundle should normally be paginated but should also be cross-referenced to copies of the documents included in the main bundles. The bundle supplied to the Court should be contained in a loose-leaf file which can easily have further documents added to it if required.

**_Bundle of authorities_**

(9) Bundles of authorities may be filed in compliance with paragraph 88(4), (5) and (6).

(10) Only authorities which are relevant or necessary for the trial shall be included in the bundles. No bundle of authorities is necessary in cases where parties are not relying on any authority at the trial. In cases where the Court is of the opinion that costs have been wasted by the inclusion of unnecessary authorities, the Court will have no hesitation in making a special order for costs against the relevant person.

(11) The bundle of authorities shall be filed and served on all relevant parties at least 3 working days before trial.

**_Opening statements_**

(12) A proper opening statement is of great assistance to the Court as it sets out the case in a nutshell, both as to facts and law. It is intended to identify both for the parties and the Judge the issues that are, and are not, in dispute. It enables the Judge to appreciate what the case is about, and what he is to look out for when reading and listening to the evidence that will follow. Opening statements also help to clarify issues between the parties, so that unnecessary time is not spent on trying to prove what is not disputed or irrelevant. The need for brevity is emphasised as opening statements that contain long and elaborate arguments, and citations from and references to numerous authorities, do not serve this purpose.

> (a) In the light of these objectives, opening statements will be required in all cases from all parties, except where dispensation has been granted by the trial Judge and in running down actions.

> (b) All opening statements must include the following:

> >  (i) the nature of the case generally and the background facts insofar as they are relevant to the matter before the Court and indicating which facts, if any, are agreed;

> >  (ii) the precise legal and factual issues involved are to be identified with cross-references as appropriate to the pleadings. These issues should be numbered and listed, and each point should be stated in no more than one or two sentences. The object here is to identify the issues in dispute and state each party's position clearly, not to argue or elaborate on them;

> >  (iii) the principal authorities in support of each legal proposition should be listed, while the key documents and witnesses supporting each factual proposition should be identified;

> >  (iv) where there is a counterclaim or third party action, the opening statement must similarly address all issues raised therein; and

> >  (v) an explanation of the reliefs claimed (if these are unusual or complicated).

> (c) The plaintiff’s statement as provided for in sub-paragraph (12)(e) below, should, unless exempted or dispensation has been granted by the trial Judge, be filed and served on all other relevant parties not less than 3 working days before the commencement of the trial for which they are to be used. 

> (d) The other counsel should each similarly not later than 2 working days before the start of the trial provide to the Court (with copies at the same time to their opponents) a statement which should concisely state the nature of their case on each of the issues to be tried and summarise the propositions of law to be advanced with references to the main authorities to be relied on. The character and length of this document will depend on the circumstances and whether there is any counterclaim or third party proceedings.

> (e) In the case of the plaintiff, the statement must include the following:

> >  (i) a summary of essential facts indicating which, if any, are agreed;

> >  (ii) an indication of how these facts are to be proved, identifying relevant witnesses and documents;

> >  (iii) a summary of the issues involved with cross-references as appropriate to the pleadings;

> >  (iv) a summary of the plaintiff’s case in relation to each of the issues with references to the key documents relied upon, and a summary of the propositions of law to be advanced with references to the main authorities to be relied on; and

> >  (v) an explanation of the reliefs claimed (if these are unusual or complicated).

> (f) In cases where the Court is of the opinion that costs or hearing days have been wasted by a poorly drafted opening statement, the Court will have no hesitation in making a special order for costs against the relevant person. 

> (g) The following format shall be adhered to when preparing opening statements:

> >  (i) all pages shall be paginated, with the first page (including the cover page) numbered as ‘Page 1’ so that the page numbers of the hard copy correspond to the page numbers in the Portable Document Format (PDF) version;

> >  (ii) the minimum font size to be used is Times New Roman 12 or its equivalent;

> >  (iii) the print of every page shall be double spaced;

> >  (iv) each page may be printed on one side or both sides; and

> >  (v) every page shall have a margin on all 4 sides, each of at least 35 mm in width.

> (h) All opening statements should not exceed 20 pages (including all annexes and appendices, but excluding the cover page and backing page).

> (i) Counsel will be at liberty to amend their statements at the trial but in such event will be expected to explain the reasons for the amendments.

**_Timeline for tendering documents_**

(13) At the trial of the cause or matter, an adjournment may be ordered if:

> (a) the above documents or any of them, save for the opening statement in cases where it is not required or dispensation was granted, were not filed and served within the prescribed time or at all; or

> (b) one party seeks to tender any of the above documents or supplements thereto except for supplements to the opening statement at the trial of the cause or matter.

(14) If an adjournment is ordered for any of the reasons set out in sub-paragraph (13) above, the party who has failed to file or serve his documents within the prescribed time or at all or who seeks to tender a document or supplement thereto except for supplements to the opening statement may be ordered by the Court to bear the costs of the adjournment. 

## 91. Hearing in Chambers

In all hearings in chambers before a Judge or Registrar, counsel shall submit their bundles of documents and their own bundle of authorities. Rule 567 of the Family Justice Rules and the requirements of Paragraphs 90(8) to (11) shall, with the necessary modifications , be complied with in this regard, save that the bundles may be submitted at the hearing itself before the Judge or Registrar, as the case may be. 

## 92. Written Submissions and Bundles of Authorities for Special Date Hearings

This paragraph applies only to hearings in the Family Division of the High Court.

(1) For any contested special date hearing before a Judge in the Family Division of the High Court, each party shall:

> (a) submit to the Court and serve on the other party a hard copy of the following documents at least 1 clear day in advance of the hearing

> >  (i) written submissions; and

> >  (ii) bundle of authorities (which are in compliance with the requirements under paragraphs 88(4), 90(9) to (11) of these Practice Directions); and

> (b) file a soft copy of his written submissions using the Electronic Filing Service no later than 1 working day after the hearing.

(2) If any party does not intend to rely on written submissions at the contested hearing referred to in sub-paragraph (1) above (e.g., where the hearing does not involve complex issues), the party should seek the Court’s approval for a waiver by way of a Request using the Electronic Filing Service at least 7 days before the hearing.

(3) This paragraph does not apply to any hearing before a Judge which is fixed on the normal list. However, parties are encouraged to adhere to the directions set out in sub- paragraph (1) above if the application will be contested. In the event that this is not done, the Judge may adjourn the hearing to enable the filing of written submissions or bundle of authorities if appropriate.

(4) For any special date hearing before a Registrar, any party who wishes to rely on written submissions at the hearing is required to comply with sub-paragraph (1) above.

(5) This paragraph does not apply to any hearings for which specific directions on the filing of written submissions or bundle of authorities are provided for in these Practice Directions. 

## 93. Citation of written judgments and secondary authorities

**_Citation of written judgments_**

Counsel who cite a judgment must state the proposition of law that the judgment establishes and the parts of the judgment that support that proposition. Such statements should not excessively add to the length of the submission but should be sufficient to demonstrate the relevance of that judgment to the argument made. Where counsel wish to cite more than two judgments as authority for a given proposition, there must be a compelling reason to do so, and this reason must be provided by counsel in submissions.

Judgments from other jurisdictions can, if judiciously used, provide valuable assistance to the Court. However, where there are in existence local judgments which are directly relevant to the issue, such judgments should be cited in precedence to foreign judgments. Relevant local judgments will be accorded greater weight than judgments from foreign jurisdictions. This will ensure that the Courts are not unnecessarily burdened with judgments made in jurisdictions with differing legal, social or economic contexts. In addition, counsel who cite a foreign judgment must:

> (a) draw the attention of the Court to any local judgment that may be relevant to whether the Court should accept the proposition that the foreign judgment is said to establish; and

> (b) ensure that such citation will be of assistance to the development of local jurisprudence on the particular issue in question.

(1) The **neutral citation system**

> (a) A neutral citation is a court-approved system of citation which is independent of the series of law reports or other publications, and unique to each written judgment.

> (b) Each written judgment from a particular level of court is assigned a sequential number, starting from 1 at the beginning of each calendar year.

(2) **Specific paragraph citations**

> (a) Counsel will be required to make specific citations by referring to the paragraph number of the judgment, and not to the page number of the judgment or report.

> (b) For consistency, square brackets will be used to denote paragraph numbers. The paragraph mark (¶) will no longer be used.

(3) **Court designators**

> SGHCF – Family Division of the High Court

> SGFC – Singapore Family Courts

> SGYC – Singapore Youth Courts

> SGDC – Singapore District Court

(4) **Application of the neutral citation system**

The application of the system is as follows:

> (a) Cases reported in the Singapore Law Reports shall be cited using their Singapore Law Reports citations, in priority to their neutral citations.

> (b) Unreported decisions shall be cited using their neutral citations.

(5) **Example and explanation**

_ABC Co Pte Ltd v XYZ Co Ltd [2015] SGFC 25, at [3], [8]._
> Year of the decision [2015]

> Level of Court SGFC (Singapore Family Courts)

> Sequential Number 25 (twenty-fifth written judgment rendered by the Family Courts in 2015)

> Paragraph Number(s) Paragraphs 3 and 8 of the judgment

> Citation of secondary authorities in court

(6) Counsel are advised to be more circumspect in their use of secondary authorities such as textbooks, journals, periodicals and other treatises. As far as possible, counsel should rely on primary authorities to support the proposition of law argued for; and

(7) If it necessary to cite secondary authorities, counsel should ensure that the material to be cited is directly relevant to the case before the Court. Counsel are also reminded of their duty to ensure that such material is not cited out of context. The following are specific guidelines for the citation of different types of secondary authorities:

> (a) Textbooks that are generally recognised as leading textbooks in the relevant area of law may be readily cited to the Court.

> (b) If counsel wish to cite academic articles in journals and periodicals in support of a particular proposition of law, they should ensure that they are citing a statement, rather than a critique, of the law. Citation of academic articles should be limited to those written by eminent authors of reputable standing. The articles should also have been published in established journals and periodicals.

> (c) Legal opinions written by other counsel not having conduct of the case before the court should generally not be cited as authority. Such legal opinions are considerably less authoritative than academic articles, as the views expressed in these private opinions have not been subject to the rigorous scrutiny of editorship and public critique.

(8) Counsel’s attention is drawn to rule 859 of the Family Justice Rules which gives the Court the power to make an order for costs personally against errant advocates and solicitors, who have wasted or incurred costs unreasonably or improperly. The Court will not hesitate to invoke its powers under rule 859 of the Family Justice Rules in cases where costs have been wasted due to counsel’s indiscriminate citation of unnecessary and irrelevant secondary authorities. 

## 94. Submissions and examination by leading and assisting counsel

(1) In the event that a party is represented by more than one counsel at a hearing, whether in Court or in chambers, the making of submissions and the questioning of witnesses may be carried out by one counsel for each party only.

(2) If party would like submissions on different issues be made or certain portions of the examination, cross- examination or re-examination be conducted by different counsel, an oral application should be made to Court as early as is practicable and by no later than the commencement of the trial or hearing for leave to do so. The following information should be provided to the Court for the purposes of the application:

> (a) the issues on which each counsel will be making submissions; and/or

> (b) the witnesses to be examined, cross-examined or re-examined by each counsel, or the portions of their evidence for which each counsel will conduct the examination, cross-examination or re-examination.

Nothing in this paragraph detracts from the responsibility of lead counsel to ensure that all counsel making submissions, or having conduct of any portion of the examination, crossexamination or re-examination of witnesses, are adequately supervised and able to handle the tasks assigned to them. 

(3) If leave has been granted in accordance with sub-paragraph (2), counsel should ensure that each confines himself to the issues or portions of evidence in respect of which leave was granted and that there is no overlap in the issues or the examination being dealt with by different counsel for the same party. Further, counsel must not repeat, clarify or expand on any submissions or portions thereof that have been made by another counsel for the same party or examine, cross-examine or re-examine witnesses on portions of their evidence dealt with by another counsel for the same party.

(4) If leave of the Court is not sought in accordance with sub-paragraph (2), only one counsel will be allowed to make submissions or conduct examination for a party throughout the hearing.

(5) For hearings in chambers, lead counsel are strongly encouraged to apprise the client of the benefits of allocating certain advocacy tasks to junior assisting counsel, including the potential benefits of reduced legal costs and increased focus by lead counsel on the main advocacy tasks, and to therefore consider obtaining instructions to make an application in accordance with subparagraph (2). In this regard, lead counsel are encouraged to consider that giving junior assisting counsel more opportunities for oral advocacy could potentially benefit the client and, at the same time, promote renewal of the Bar.

(6) For civil trials: 
 
> (a) Notwithstanding sub-paragraphs (1) and (2), and save where lead counsel is a junior counsel, the junior assisting counsel shall deliver the oral opening statement unless the Court otherwise orders; and 

> (b) lead counsel are to inform the trial judge at the Judge Pre-Trial Conference (“JPTC”), or if a JPTC has not been fixed, at the start of the trial, whether their client will be making an application pursuant to sub-paragraph (2) above and, if so, the proposed division of advocacy tasks between lead counsel and junior assisting counsel. 
 
(7) This Paragraph shall apply to all proceedings in the Family Courts, Youth Courts and Family Division of the High Court. 

## 95. Amendment of documents

**_General requirements for amendment of any document_**

(1) Except as otherwise provided by the provisions of this Paragraph, where any document (inclusive of any pleading) that has been filed in any proceedings is required to be amended and re-filed in Court, a fresh copy of the document with the amendments included must be prepared, regardless of the number and length of the amendments sought to be made.

(2) The procedure for amending a document is as follows:

> (a) A fresh amended copy of the document should be produced.

> (b) The number of times the document has been amended shall be indicated (in brackets) after the name of the document. For this purpose, an amended document should be entitled “[document name] (Amendment No. 1)” or “[document name] (Amendment No. 2)”, or as appropriate. For example, a Statement of Claim which is amended for the first time should be filed as “Statement of Claim (Amendment No. 1)”, and a Defence that is amended for the second time should be filed as “Defence (Amendment No. 2)”.

> (c) The changes made in the document from the latest version of the document filed in Court should be indicated in the following way:

> >  (i) deletions shall be made by drawing a single line across the words to be deleted; and

> >  (ii) insertions shall be underlined.

**_Colour scheme for amendments_**

(3) In addition, the following colours shall be used to indicate the history of the amendments in the specified documents:

> (a) black for the first round of amendments;

> (b) red for the second round of amendments;

> (c) green for the third round of amendments;

> (d) blue for the fourth round of amendments; and

> (e) brown for subsequent rounds of amendments.

**_Amendment for third time or more_**

(4) From the _third_ round of amendments onwards, the amended specified document should comprise two versions of the document, i.e. —

> (a) a clean version without the amendments shown; followed in the same document
by

> (b) a version showing the amendments in colour.

(5) Only one amended document consisting of these two versions is required to be filed.

**_Cases to which the requirements in sub-paragraphs (1) and (2) do not apply_**

(6) The directions in sub-paragraph (2)(b) above shall not apply to any originating summons or summons that has been amended from an _inter partes_ application to an _ex parte_ application or _vice versa_.

(7) The directions in sub-paragraphs (2)(c) above shall not apply to any originating process, summons or other electronic form that is composed online through the Electronic Filing Service.

**_Amendment endorsements on electronic forms_**

(8) Rule 426(3) of the Family Justice Rules requires that an amended pleading or other document be endorsed with a statement that it has been amended, specifying the date on which it was amended and by whom the order (if any) authorising the amendment was made and the date thereof, and if no such order was made, the number of the Rule in Part 18 Division 14 of the Family Justice Rules in pursuance of which the amendment was made.

(9) Where electronic forms are amended, the amendment endorsement shall take either one of the following forms:

> (a) “By order of court made on [date order was made]”; or

> (b) “Pursuant to Rule [cite specific rule number]”.

(10) The amendment endorsement shall be appended to the title of the electronic form, after the amendment number as required under sub-paragraph (2)(b) above. Where an electronic form is amended more than once, the endorsement need only cite the basis for the most recent amendment. For example —

> (a) “Originating Summons (Amendment No. 3, by order of court made on 1 January 2013)”;

> (b) “Writ of Summons (Amendment No. 1, pursuant to r420)”.

(11) The date of the electronic form shall reflect the date on which the document is amended.

**_Amendments made on original writ or originating summons (where amendments are not numerous or lengthy)_**

(12) This sub-paragraph applies to writs and originating summonses that have not been filed using the Electronic Filing Service. In addition to the usual endorsement signed by the solicitors pursuant to Paragraph 73 of these Practice Directions, there should be re- sealing of the document as required by rule 426(1), of the Family Justice Rules. The seal will be embossed over the endorsement.

**_Amendment of case title to add a party_**

(13) Where leave of Court has been obtained to add a party to the main case title of a matter, for example, an intervener, a garnishee or any party that was previously a non-party, the applicant or his solicitor is to file a Request through the Electronic Filing Service to add that specific party to the main case title.

For trials, it is the period from the last court mentions/case conference (when parties indicate they are ready) to the date of hearing. For interlocutory matters, the waiting time is usually calculated from the date of filing. In the majority of cases, the matter should be heard within the time frames as indicated above. It is only in exceptional circumstances that the time frame is departed from.

## 97. Request for urgent hearing dates or urgent hearings prior to the filing of the application through the Electronic Filing Service

Counsel requesting an urgent hearing before the Duty Registrar or Duty District Judge, or an urgent hearing date, in respect of an application that has not yet been filed through the Electronic Filing Service, shall submit a hard copy of the proposed application and any supporting affidavit to the Duty Registrar or Duty District Judge for the Court’s retention and shall give an undertaking to file the application and supporting affidavit using the Electronic Filing Service by the next working day. 

## 98. Requesting a hearing date through the Electronic Filing Service

(1) When filing applications through the Electronic Filing Service, solicitors may make a request for a preferred hearing date for any interlocutory application to be heard before a Registrar.

(2) Solicitors should confer with all parties to the application before selecting a preferred hearing date. Every counsel arguing the application should be available to attend the hearing on the date selected.

(3) In the event that it is not possible to confer with opposing counsel on a preferred hearing date, whether due to the nature or urgency of the application or otherwise, solicitors must select a date when counsel arguing the application for the applicant will be available.

(4) Solicitors are reminded to satisfy the requirements of subparagraph 76(6) of these Practice Directions.

(1) Where dates have been fixed for the trial of any cause or matter, any request for an adjournment or vacation of the trial dates shall be made to a Judge or Registrar by way of summons with a supporting affidavit even in those cases where counsel for the other party or parties consent to the adjournment.

(2) Subject to any directions of the Judge or Registrar, when a case is adjourned, the Registrar will assign such days as are available for the hearing of the case, and counsel will be expected to take the dates at short notice. Where counsel is unable for any reason to take the dates, he shall apply to the Judge or Registrar for an adjournment in accordance with sub-paragraph (1) above.

(3) In the event that the hearing of a case is not concluded within the number of days allotted, the Court may direct the hearing of the case to continue beyond the allotted time rather than adjourning the case part-heard to another date. Counsel for parties in all cases should therefore be prepared to continue with the hearing of the matter notwithstanding the fact that the time originally allotted may have expired. Subject to any such directions of the Court, all part-heard cases shall be fixed for continued hearing at short notice.

**_Access by parties to a case file_**

(1) All parties to a case who are registered users of the Electronic Filing Service may, subject to this paragraph and any directions of the Court, access the online case file made available through the Electronic Filing Service and may inspect, download soft copies or print hard copies of documents accessible to the parties in the online case file.

(2) Where a party to a case is not a registered user and is unable to access the electronic case file through the Electronic Filing Service, the procedure governing file inspection by non-parties to a case in sub-paragraph (5) below shall be followed.

(3) All parties to a case shall have the liberty to make amendments at will to administrative details contained in the electronic case file through the Electronic Filing Service, and for this purpose —

> (a) administrative details include the contact details of solicitors, the identities of the solicitors, and the nature of the claim; and

> (b) where a party to a case is not a registered user of the Electronic Filing Service, he may attend at the service bureau to seek assistance to amend the administrative details contained in the electronic case file.

(4) The Registry may require parties to a case to provide supporting documents to substantiate proposed amendments to other details of the electronic case file before the amendment is approved (e.g. amendments to add or remove a party to the case have to be supported by an order of court, and amendments to change the name, gender, identification number, or marital status of a party to the case have to be substantiated by documentary proof).

**_File inspection by non-parties_**

(5) In order to inspect a case file containing documents that were filed through the Electronic Filing Service, the following procedure should be followed:

> (a) A Request should be made to obtain leave to inspect the file, which request should —

> >  (i) be filed using the Electronic Filing Service;

> >  (ii) state the name of the person who is to carry out the search or inspection (and if this person is not a solicitor, his identity card number should also be included in the request, after his name, and a copy of his identity card should be provided);

> >  (iii) state the interest the applicant has in the matter, and the reason for the search or inspection; and

> >  (iv) if the search or inspection is requested for the purpose of ascertaining information for use in a separate suit or matter, clearly state the nature of the information sought and the relevance of such information to the separate suit or matter.

> (b) Once approval for inspection has been received from the Court:

> >  (i) Registered users can inspect the case file online through the Electronic Filing Service;

> >  (ii) Parties who are not registered users can inspect the case file by presenting a copy of the approval at the service bureau. After verifying the approval that has been presented, the service bureau will assign a personal computer to the inspecting party for the inspection to be carried out. An inspecting party will usually be allowed only 60 minutes to carry out the inspection. If a longer period is required, the service bureau may impose a charge for use of the computer. The service bureau may impose additional charges for downloading soft copies or printing hard copies of documents from the case file being inspected.

(6) Requests in hard copy may be submitted to inspect case files containing documents which were not filed using the Electronic Filing Service. The Family Registry will only accept requests which are printed or typewritten on paper of good quality and signed by the solicitors concerned. Requests which have any erasure marks on them will be rejected. Requests which are double stamped, that is, if the requests were originally short stamped and later stamped to add up to the correct fee, may be rejected.

(7) Solicitors must communicate to the Registrar in writing the names of their clerks who have their authority to make searches and inspections. Such authority may be in respect of a specific search or inspection or for a specified period. 

(8) For the avoidance of doubt, a non-party who has obtained approval to inspect a case file may take and retain a soft copy of any document that is available for inspection. All copies of documents taken in the course of inspection should not be used for purposes other than those stated in the Request to inspect.

## 111. Swearing or affirming of affidavits, statutory declarations and oaths

(1) Rule 8 of the Commissioners for Oaths Rules (Cap. 322, Rule 3) was amended effective 1 September 1998 to permit an advocate and solicitor who is appointed a commissioner for oaths to take affidavits or statutory declarations, or administer oaths to a deponent in a language or dialect, other than English, spoken or understood by the deponent and in which the advocate and solicitor is proficient in. Given these amendments, advocates and solicitors are requested to encourage their clients to use the services of other advocates and solicitors who are appointed commissioners for oaths and who are proficient in the language or dialect in which the affidavits or statutory declarations are to be sworn or affirmed, or in which the oaths are to be taken. The Family Justice Courts' commissioners for oaths will continue to take affidavits or statutory declarations and administer oaths for legally aided cases and for parties who are acting in person who need to file documents in the Family Justice Courts.

(2) If arrangements for the use of the services of advocates and solicitors who are appointed as commissioners for oaths are not possible, deponents who are blind or illiterate in English may continue to be brought by solicitors to the Family Justice Courts' commissioners for oaths to swear or affirm affidavits and statutory declarations. As the Family Justice Courts' commissioners for oaths are under a duty to ensure that the deponent understands the document being deposed to, they are obliged to interpret the document to intended deponents; this is also the case in relation to blind deponents. This necessary exercise may take a considerable time and may cause long delays for other persons who wish to take affidavits or statutory declarations before the Family Justice Courts' commissioners for oaths.

(3) Accordingly, solicitors who wish to bring illiterate or blind deponents before the Family Justice Courts' commissioners for oaths should first estimate the time that will be taken to interpret the document or documents to be deposed to. If it is estimated that the total time required for interpretation of the documents will be more than 20 minutes, the solicitor must write to the Registrar and arrange for a special appointment for the documents to be sworn or affirmed; the solicitor should not bring the deponent before the duty commissioner for oaths without such an appointment.

(4) If an illiterate or a blind deponent is brought before the duty Family Justice Courts commissioner for oaths and the interpretation of the document or documents takes more than 20 minutes, the commissioner for oaths will refer the solicitor and the deponent to the Registrar for a special appointment to be made for the documents to be deposed to. 

(5) Save in exceptional circumstances, the Family Justice Courts will not entertain requests from advocates and solicitors for its commissioners for oaths to swear or affirm affidavits or statutory declarations or administer oaths to a deponent outside the Family Justice Courts’ premises. Advocates and solicitors appointed as commissioners for 

oaths and who are proficient in the language or dialect in which the affidavits or statutory declarations are to be sworn or affirmed, or in which oaths are to be taken, are instead encouraged to perform this function 

## 112. Effect of non-compliance

Any affidavit or exhibit which does not comply with the Directions contained in this Part will be liable to be rejected by the Court and made the subject of an order for costs. 

## 113. Objections to the contents of affidavits of evidence-in- chief

(1) If, on an application for directions under rule 482, or rule 583 of the Family Justice Rules, or otherwise, orders are made prescribing the time within which objection to the contents of affidavits of evidence-in-chief must be taken, the objections must be taken in accordance with the Directions contained in this Paragraph and not otherwise.

(2) Objections to the contents of affidavits of evidence-in-chief filed pursuant to an order of the Court made under rule 482, or rule 583 of the Family Justice Rules, or otherwise, must be taken by filing and serving a notice in Form 246 of Appendix A. 

(3) The notice in Form 246 should set out all the objections to the contents of affidavits of evidence-in-chief that will be raised at the hearing of the cause or matter and all the grounds thereof.

(4) An adjudication on the material objected to in affidavits of evidence-in-chief filed pursuant to an order of the Court should only be sought at the trial or hearing of the cause or matter for which the affidavits of evidence-in-chief were filed, and not before. If an adjudication is sought prior to the trial or hearing of the cause or matter, the application for the adjudication will be adjourned to be dealt with at the trial or hearing of the cause or matter, and the applicant may be ordered to pay the costs of the adjournment. 

## 114. Draft orders of Court

(1) **Draft orders for** **_inter partes_** **applications**

> (a) Rules 676(1), (2) and (3) of the Family Justice Rules places the burden of approving the drafts of inter partes judgments and orders on the solicitors themselves. The solicitors should therefore approve the drafts and not submit these drafts to the Registrar for approval.

> (b) The Registrar's signature on a judgment or order is only for the purpose of validity and does not in any way affect the regularity or irregularity of the contents of any judgment or order.

> (c) Subject to sub-paragraph (d), parties in _inter partes_ applications should proceed to engross a final copy of the draft judgment for signature by the Registrar _after_ agreeing on the draft. Draft orders of Court for _ex parte_ applications (except probate matters) may be submitted with the summons and the supporting affidavit when these are filed.

> (d) For draft orders in electronic form that are composed online through the Electronic Filing Service, the process for extracting judgments and orders shall be as follows:

> >  (i) Parties have the option of filing a system-generated order of court through the Electronic Filing Service.

> >  (ii) Before filing the system-generated order of court, the party extracting the order must review and edit the order of court electronic form to ensure that it accurately reflects the orders made by the Court and obtain the approval of all other parties to the application and provide evidence of such approval when filing the draft order of court, for example, a Portable Document Format (PDF) copy of a draft order of court signed by the solicitors of all parties to the application.

> (e) Where parties disagree over one or more terms of the order of court, the party filing the draft order of court shall be responsible for including in the order of court electronic form all versions of the disputed terms by editing the order of court electronic form.

(5) The draft consent orders must be signed — 
 
> (a) in the case where any party is represented, by that parties’ counsel; or 
 
> (b) in the case where any party is unrepresented and another is represented, by that unrepresented party personally, and subject to the following requirements: 

> >  (i) the signature of that unrepresented party must be witnessed by an advocate and solicitor or a commissioner for oaths not acting for any of the other parties in the proceedings.

## 155. Filing directions to the Accountant-General for payment into and out of Court
